const reducer = (state, action) => {
 return {count: state.count + 1}
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {count: 0})

const increment = () => {
dispatch()
}

here reducer is the updating function
dispatch is the function that calls the reducer on certian parameters
the action is the function that we will  call in the dispatch
so every time we call the dispatch function the reducer will return the new state by executing the action

in case of a multiple actions such as increment or decrement we do the following

const reducer = (state, action) => {
 switch (action.type) {
case "increment" : 
return {count: state.count + 1}
break;
case "increment" : 
return {count: state.count - 1}
break;
case default: 
return  state
}
}

const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, {count: 0})

const increment = () => {
dispatch({type:"decrement"})
}

const increment = () => {
dispatch({type:"decrement"})
}
